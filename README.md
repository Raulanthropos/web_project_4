## Around the U.S.

### This project is part of the curriculum at Practicum by Yandex. For this project we utilised HTML, CSS, Figma and Javascript.

#### More specifically, we were provided with a layout on Figma, that we recreated by utilising code. We used the BEM methodology to sort the filing system, and added a .js file; the javaScript part of this project provides functionality by handling DOM events and manipulating the DOM by assigning properties to buttons, producing modal windows with custom input properties and a semi-transparent whole page layout that triggers with an event listener. We also add the option for users to customize the layout by adding and/or removing places and titles. The layout is responsive, with a fully functional and pleasant mobile version. We used media queries with custom resolutions to achieve a smooth result. In the latest version of this implementation, we added Validation and improved the UX, with the added functionality of removing the modal windows by pressing the Esc key or clicking on the outer overlay.
