# web_project_4_

##Around the U.S.

###This project is part of the curriculum at Practicum by Yandex. For this project we utilised HTML, CSS, Figma and Javascript.

####More specifically, we were provided with a layout on Figma, that we recreated by utilising code. We used the BEM methodology to sort the filing system, and added a .js file; The javascript part of this project provides functionality by handling DOM events and manipulating the DOM by assigning properties to buttons, a modal window with custom input properties, a semi-transparent whole page layout that triggers with an event listener. The layout is also responsive, with a fully functional and pleasant mobile version - We used media queries with custom resolutions to achieve a smooth result.
