## Around the U.S.

### This project is part of the curriculum at Practicum by Yandex. For this project we utilised HTML, CSS, Figma and Javascript.

#### More specifically, we were provided with a layout on Figma, that we recreated by utilising code. We used the BEM methodology to sort the filing system, and added a .js file; the javaScript part of this project provides functionality by handling DOM events and manipulating the DOM by assigning properties to buttons, producing modal windows with custom input properties and a semi-transparent whole page layout that triggers with an event listener. We also add the option for users to customize the layout by adding and/or removing places and titles. The layout is responsive, with a fully functional and pleasant mobile version. We used media queries with custom resolutions to achieve a smooth result. - Pending adding form validation - ongoing!
